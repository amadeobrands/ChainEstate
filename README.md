<Strong>Concept:</Strong>
Chain Estate created A model to tokenize office space and create a more efficient real estate market. The idea comes forth from the wanxiang blockchain labs (http://www.wxblockchain.com) Hackathon we did in Shanghai where we won #1 first price and a sponsor price to fly over to Chicago to participate in the Factom off chain smart contract hackathon where we won #2 second price. 

During the hackathons We made a model to tokenize office space. Instead of expansive and insecure Agents selling office space we have built a smart contract with embedded KYC and whitelist that will enable a more liquid real estate market. Each project/building will have its own ERC20 token and then each floor will have its own ERC721 to separate ownership, better control of open space and easy budget management. In Chicago we expanded this idea with an identity chain for the landlord, leaser and the property with this setup it would enable a multichain infrastructure across different real-estate projects that can connect with each other. We have a working demo and code which can been seen on our Github https://github.com/amadeobrands/ChainEstate 

At this stage we are looking for potential funding and support to punch this idea forward. We have contacts in China and Japan that are interested in punching this idea forward and we have potentially a big real estate developer in Hangzhou Chania that wants to be our launching customer.
