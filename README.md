<Strong>Concept:</Strong>
We made a model to tokenize office space. Instead of expansive and insecure Agents selling office space we have build an smart contracts with embedded KYC and whitelist that will enable a more liquid real estate market. Each project/building will have it's own ERC20 token and then each floor will have its own ERC721 to separate ownership, better control of open space and easy budget management.
