<Strong>Concept:</Strong>
Chain Estate created a business model to tokenize office spaces, which results in a more efficient real estate market. The idea emerges from the prestigious Wanxiang Blockchain Labs (http://www.wxblockchain.com) Hackathon in Shanghai. Where on the spot we've won the first price. The first price included a sponsor price and flight tickets to Chicago to participate in the Factom off chain smart contract hackathon where we won #2 second price. 

During the hackathons, we have made a model to tokenize office spaces. Instead of expensive and insecure agents selling office space we have built a smart contract with embedded KYC and whitelist that will enable a more liquid real estate market. Each project/building will have its own dedicated ERC20 token and following up each floor will have its own ERC721 to separate ownership. This ensures better control of open space and makes it more convient for budget management. In Chicago we expanded this idea with the identity chain for the landlord, leaser and the designated property. This setup would enable a multichain infrastructure across different real-estate projects that can connect with each other. 

We have a working demo and code which can been seen on our Github https://github.com/amadeobrands/ChainEstate 

At this stage we are looking for potential funding and support to punch this idea forward. We have business connections spread around in China and Japan that are interested in pushing this idea forward and we have potentially a big real estate developer in Hangzhou Chania that wants to be our first launching customer.
